        <h2>About this Project</h2>
          <p>This project was part of my CLASS NAME. For this project I had to create a story from a song. This included writing a statement piece, creating an image board, and costume renderings.</p>

        <h2>Statement Paper</h2>
          <p>My piece is titled “Behind Closed Doors” and is inspired by the song “Beyond This Moment”. The piece follows a woman who is in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. The piece takes place in current day and has a realistic set and feel to it. The show focuses on heavy topics and is intended for older children and adults.</p>
          <p>The show will take place on a thrust stage with a simple set. There will be a kitchen table set with plates and wine glasses. A coat rack and door should be off to the side as well, with a sink and window between the table and front door. Upstage there will be see through curtain. The action that takes place at the table will allude to what happens behind the curtain. At the table, the audience sees more of the emotional abuse. At the beginning of the piece everything should seem normal. The lighting should be warm and welcoming. Soon enough though, the man begins to show signs of annoyance and yells at the woman. The tension builds and eventually he storms off behind the curtain and the woman follows him to attempt to smooth things over. Once both actors are behind the curtain the lighting changes. They are illuminated from behind with red lighting and all we see is their silhouettes. This is where the physical abuse happens.</p>
          <p>The man hurts the woman enough for her to back down but never to a point where she is too injured to return to the table. He emerges from behind the curtain and returns to the table. He has a spotlight on him while the woman’s silhouette is still seen behind the curtain, collecting herself. The couple begins to eat again, and the tension dispels, until the woman makes a small mistake such as knocking over a wine glass or dropping her fork. This sets the man off again, and the cycle begins again. The yelling and then eventually returning to behind the curtain where the physical abuse happens. This cycle repeats twice after the first time and after the last time behind the curtain, the woman has a black eye and smudged mascara and has added a long sleeve shirt underneath her jumpsuit to cover cuts and bruises on her arms. The woman takes longer to collect herself after the final time behind the curtain, even beyond the costume change.</p>
          <p>After coming back from behind the curtain for the third time, the woman does not rejoin her partner at the table. She remains standing and is looking out the window. Despite the abuse that she has gone through, her posture and motions are strong. The man does not notice her change in attitude and continues to eat his meal. The woman walks over to a coat rack and pulls on a coat. This finally catches the man’s attention. He jumps to his feet and tries to reason with the woman. In contrast to what we have seen before, he is very sweet in this moment. He is gentle with the woman and is begging her to stay. The woman however has had enough and dismisses his pleas. She stands her ground and walks out the door, leaving the man begging on his knees. The stage goes dark.</p>
          <p>This production will take place on a thrust stage. The kitchen set should be out where the audience is. It should be easy for every audience member to see all the action that takes place while the man and woman eat their meal. The curtain that hides the abuse should be set much further back on the stage, not in line with any of the audience. This forces the audience to have to adjust their seating to see what is happening behind the curtain. In many abusive relationships, those outside of it do not see what is going on. The signs are not always obvious and will not be seen without effort. This is being reflected in having the curtain set far back. The audience needs to work to see the abuse. If they don’t work to see behind the curtain, all they will see is a fighting couple and none of the physical abuse.</p>
