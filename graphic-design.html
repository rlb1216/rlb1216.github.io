      <h2>About this Page</h2>
        <p>On this page I have included some of the work I have created using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign.</p>
        <p>The first project was to put together a brochure for a company and I chose the beauty brand Pleasing. The second project was to create a magazine spread with one two page spread with an insert and one one page spread article.</p>
