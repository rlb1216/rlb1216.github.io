      <h2>About this Page</h2>
        <p>On this page I have included some of the work I have created using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign.</p>
        <p>The first project was to put together a brochure for a company and I chose the beauty brand Pleasing. The second project was to create a magazine spread with one two page spread with an insert and one one page spread article.</p>

          <img src="images/outside.jpeg" alt="outside of brochure about Pleasing" width="400"/>
          <figcaption>
            To create this brochure I was provided a layout but all other elements such as the images and colors I added myself.

        <figure>
          <img src="images/inside.jpeg" alt="inside of brochure about Pleasing" width="400"/>
          <figcaption>
            Similarly to the outside, I was provided a template but all the elements, including font and images, I added myself. The pictures of the products were cropped out of larger images using Illustrator.

        <figure>
          <img src="images/magazine.jpeg" alt="cover of magazine featuring Zendaya" width="337"/>
          <figcaption>
            To create this magazine cover I added all the elements including the picture of Zendaya, the text, and even the barcode.

        <figure>
          <img src="images/inside-1.jpeg" alt="inside spread of magazine article about Zendaya" width="575"/>
          <figcaption>
            For the inside spread I designed the layout of the paragraphs, and determined the best shade of pink for the text so it would compliment the image.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/inside-2.jpeg" alt="continued spread of magazine article about Zendaya" width="575"/>
          <figcaption>
            For the second inside spread I once again layed out the paragraphs, and timeline of images at the bottom. I also created the pie chart showing which look was the readers' favorite.

        <figure>
          <img src="images/inside-3.jpeg" alt="spread of magazine article about men wearing skirts" width="575"/>
          <figcaption>
            For the final spread, I once again layed out the paragraphs. I alse collaged the images of men in skirts, created another pie chart, and created the map showing different areas where it is common for men to wear skirts.
