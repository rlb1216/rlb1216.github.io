      <h2>Tunnel of Oppression applications are now open, but what is the Tunnel of Oppression?</h2>
        <p>Since 2008, the Tunnel of Oppression has been a staple of the University of Miami’s spring semester. Occurring in January, the event is a multi-sensory student led experience focusing on different kinds of oppression both domestic and international.</p>
        <p>“It has had various topics from education, LGBTQ+ rights, gender issues, ableism, a religion room,” said Collette Mighty, a Butler Center employee. Since the event is student led and the executive board is different each year, the topics covered are never the same but Mighty said that racism and environmental issues tend to come up often. “Everybody says in 30 years Miami is going to be under water, so our students are really sort of eco-conscious,” she said. </p>

        <p>Ashlee Sealy, a senior biochemistry and molecular biology major, is one of the co-chairs of the event this year. She first got involved with the Tunnel of Oppression her freshmen year as a member of the auxiliary board, the team that helps build the different rooms of the experience. “My desire for wanting to be co-chair was really from me having already participated in Tunnel since my freshmen year,” Sealy said. She also said seeing ideas go from paper to being built was exciting to see.</p>
        <p>While previous years have seen similar topics of oppression come up, this year’s event will highlight something new: the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and oppression. “We’re definitely going to add disparities from Covid because that is a huge form of oppression that we’ve seen been exposed since March of 2020,” Sealy said.</p>
        <p>There is a lot to take in when it comes to Tunnel of Oppression. “We don’t want to necessarily just have a shock factor we want to have a reflective factor as well,” Mighty said. Sealy also said that it is important for students to come to the Tunnel of Oppression with open minds.</p>
        <p>At the end of the experience, there is the reflection room. “That’s where you can kind of come to assemble all your ideas and everything you’ve learned going through the different rooms of oppression,” Sealy said. The goal of the experience is to remind students to show empathy and compassion to others, as many are experiencing their own forms of oppression. “That’s something that I think is beautiful about Tunnel of Oppression,” Sealy said.</p>
        <p>Applications for this year’s executive board are open, but it is not just a simple click of a button to apply. Applicants are asked to share what they are passionate about in their initial application. “If you just want to put this on your resume this is not the e-board for you,” Mighty said. Applicants will also go through an interview process after their initial application has been reviewed.</p>
        <p>The e-board requires commitment in addition to passion. The rough timeline of the event includes weekly meetings from Sept. 2021 to Jan. 2022 and a whole weekend build from Jan. 21, 2022, to Jan. 23, 2022, to get the experience ready.</p>
        <p>Applications are open now and will close Sunday, Sept. 26, 2021. If students are interested in applying they should go to miami.edu/leadandserve.</p>

      <h2>How To Update Your Wardrobe Sustainably</h2>
        <p>Jaclyn Torn feels like she is constantly updating her wardrobe. Torn, a junior at the University of Miami, has been taking medication to treat depression for four years and with that has come weight fluctuation. She finds that many times over the past four years she’s found herself in front of her closet with nothing to wear.</p>
        <p>Whether it’s because of weight fluctuation, or because of changing trends, sitting in front of a closet with nothing to wear is a feeling many women know. It’s easy to throw all the unwanted items in a bag to throw out, and head to the mall, but it’s also easy, and important, to update your closet sustainably.</p>
        <p>“Fashion is the second top polluter after oil and gas,” said Anna Coon, the president of UThrift at the University of Miami. Coon also shared that most people only wear clothing items six or seven times before they throw them away, which only adds to the pollution. With the ever changing climate crisis, fashion is a simple way for individuals to do a small part to help.</p>
        <p>“Clothing is one of the easiest ways to make your life more eco and sustainable,” Coon said.</p>
        <p>Below are four easy ways to update your closet sustainably and help the environment.</p>
      <h3>Swap Clothes With Friends</h3>
        <p>Have you spent years eyeing your friend’s green sweater, wishing you had one just like it? Or is your friend always asking to have your leather jacket when you buy a new one? Hosting a swap night with some of your close friends is the best solution to these problems.</p>
        <p>Get together with food and drinks and take turns choosing clothes to take home. Swap nights have multiple benefits: you walk away with new additions to your wardrobe, get rid of old things you don’t want and get to spend time with friends. A win-win-win.</p>
        <p>Anika Markan, a junior at the University of Miami, has three roommates and she loves being able to swap clothes with them.</p>
        <p>“It always feels like there’s a new trend that our age group is sporting, so it’s nice to always have friends that you feel comfortable swapping clothes with so you can try new things without having to spend money on a whole new wardrobe and a better alternative to fast fashion,” she said.</p>
      <h3>Go Thrifting</h3>
        <p>Thrift stores are a great place to find anything and everything when it comes to clothes. Big stores like Goodwill have a large selection of clothes, including basic tees and jeans, and even prom dresses, at a discounted price.</p>
        <p>If your style is inspired by specific decades, look for vintage stores in your area. Vintage stores may be a little more expensive but you’re sure to walk away with unique pieces.</p>
        <p>“I love thrifting cause I feel like old trends and fashion can come back or you can style it to fit your own style,” said University of Miami sophomore Ella Green.</p>
      <h3>Upcycle</h3>
        <p>Remember that dress you thought you would wear all the time, but it ended up being an awkward length and then lived in the back of your closet? You don’t have to throw it away.</p>
        <p>Dresses that are too long can easily be hemmed or turned into cute shirt and skirt two piece sets. Jeans can be turned into shorts with just a pair of scissors. The white shirt stained with coffee? Embrace it and dye the whole thing brown.</p>
        <p>When it comes to upcycling, YouTube is your friend. There are hundreds of tutorials on upcycling and “thrift flips” that can help guide and inspire you to revamp your old clothes.</p>
      <h3>Look Online</h3>
        <p>Believe it or not, many places online sell clothing that isn’t brand new. ThredUP describes itself as an “online consignment and thrift store for your closet, your wallet and the planet”. Users can browse thousands of products including maternity clothes and kids’ clothes.</p>
        <p>Users can also order a Clean Out Kit which allows users to easily send their clothes to sell through ThredUP. If their products sell, users can cash out or get shopping credit.</p>
        <p>Apps like Depop also allow users to sell and buy gently used clothes. Depop allows users to list their own items and communicate directly with buyers to negotiate price. Sellers are also responsible for shipping items that sell. Like ThredUP, Depop gives users a wide variety of items to choose from.</p>
        <p>“You get a wide variety of people from all over the country with different styles, different colors, different patterns and also different brands,” said University of Miami junior Kavya Jain, who has both purchased items from Depop and listed her own items to sell.</p>
        <p>Next time you find yourself standing in your closet saying: “I have nothing to wear.”, try one of these alternatives before heading to the mall. You’ll walk away with new items for your wardrobe and done your part to help the environment.</p>
